# quiver
My quiver of knowledge and tools. Inspired by [Learn In Public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public) 

## Rendir Quentas (to be accountable in spanish)

The idea here is to start simple and add from there. Do it, then optimize it. no need to overthink it. [dailies](dailies) contain markdown files of my daily goals and reports. I will also just write what I am doing and record anything I feel is important. If I feel something I write deserves its own markdown file I will move it to [research](research).

### Rules
1. Push once a day. 
	- include daily plan and report.
2. Make a PR request once a day for [Gus](https://github.com/glwhart/researchDiary/tree/main).
3. No more than 10 mins. on plan/report/PR.
