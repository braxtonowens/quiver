My quiver of knowledge and tools. Inspired by [Learn In Public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public) 

## Rendir Quentas (to be accountable in spanish)

This is an attempt between student and advisor to keep each other accountable. We both have a repository that we push to daily. The other is responsible for reviewing the PR and providing feedback if desired. Free to change as we go.

### Rules
1. Push once a day. 
	- include daily plan and report.
2. Make a PR request once a day for other participant/s.
3. No more than 10 mins. on plan/report/PR.


## Goals and Plans Inspired by [PMG](https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/preach-my-gospel-2023/16-chapter-8?lang=eng)
